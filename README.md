## How To
_coming soon..._


## App inspiration
With all of the new knowledge I have been garnering, I wanted to create a platform on which I could experiment and let my creations free.

The idea is simple: build something to represent myself as a developer. But from there is where the fun begins. As stated, I want this to be an ever evolving platform to host small projects or other content. In a sense this will be the landing site for putting my name out there as an up and coming developer.

For the initial development stage I will be focusing on creating a general portfolio type website. Inclusion of a chat room type feature will help accomplish requirements set.
